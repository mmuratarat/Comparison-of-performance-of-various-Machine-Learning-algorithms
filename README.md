# Comparison-of-performance-of-various-Machine-Learning-algorithms
Compared performance of 12 different Machine Learning algorithms on "Iris Dataset" 

Below is list of classifiers used for comparison in this assignment.
1) Decision Trees
2) Perceptron
3) Neural Net
4) Deep Learning
5) SVM
6) Naïve Bayes
7) Logistic Regression
8) k-Nearest Neighbors
9) Bagging
10) Random Forests
11) AdaBoost
12) Gradient Boosting
Most of classifiers are implemented using Python’s Scikit-Learn, except Deep learning which was implemented
using Tensor flow package. Anaconda’s Spyder IDE was used for development of code and execution
